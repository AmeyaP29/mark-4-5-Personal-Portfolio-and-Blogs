    <h1>5 Tips for a Successful Morning Routine</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of feeling rushed and stressed out every morning? It's time to create a successful morning routine
        that sets you up for a productive and successful day. Here are five tips to get you started:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up at the same time every day. Your body functions best when it has a consistent sleep schedule, so aim
            to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This will help you feel more rested and energized in
            the morning.</li>
        <li>Plan out your morning the night before. Before you go to bed, take a few minutes to lay out your clothes,
            pack your lunch, and make a to-do list for the next day. This will save you time and reduce stress in the
            morning.</li>
        <li>Exercise or meditate. Starting your day with a bit of physical activity or a few minutes of mindfulness can
            help you feel energized and focused.</li>
        <li>Eat a healthy breakfast. Skipping breakfast or filling up on sugary foods can leave you feeling sluggish and
            hungry later in the day. Instead, try to eat a balanced breakfast with protein, fiber, and complex carbs to
            keep you fueled until lunchtime.</li>
        <li>Limit screen time. It can be tempting to check your phone or scroll through social media as soon as you wake
            up, but this can actually increase stress and decrease productivity. Try to limit screen time in the morning
            and save it for later in the day.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By implementing these simple tips, you can create a successful morning routine that will help you start your day
        off on the right foot.</p>
